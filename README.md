## Cover Letter

Dear Reviewer,

I am Anmol Ratan Srivastava, a student from India pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am excited to present my project, **Train Seat Booking System Using Angular**, which I have developed as part of my assignment.

The project is a comprehensive seat booking system for a train coach with 80 seats. It includes functionalities to book seats, view seat availability, and handle pre-booked seats. I hope you find the solution both functional and user-friendly.

Thank you for reviewing my assignment.

Best regards,  
Anmol Ratan Srivastava

## Project Overview

The **Train Seat Booking System Using Angular** is designed to manage seat reservations for a train coach with 80 seats. The coach is structured with 10 rows of 7 seats each and 1 row with 3 seats at the end. Users can book up to 7 seats at a time with priority given to booking within a single row, and if not possible, the system will book nearby seats.

## Features

- **Seat Booking**: Allows users to book up to 7 seats at a time.
- **Seat Layout**: Displays a visual representation of the seat layout with availability status.
- **Pre-Booked Seats**: Handles pre-booked seats and avoids double-booking.
- **Availability Check**: Provides feedback on seat availability and booking status.

## Project Structure

- **src/app/app.component.ts**: Contains the main logic for seat booking and initialization.
- **src/app/app.component.html**: Provides the HTML template for displaying seat status and booking interface.
- **src/app/app.component.css**: Styles the seat booking interface.
- **schema.sql**: SQL file containing the database schema and sample data.

## Getting Started

To run the Train Seat Booking System locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arssite/train-seat-booking-using-angular.git
   cd train-seat-booking
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `https://angular-7uzupk.stackblitz.io` to view the application.

## Database Setup

1. **Database Schema**: The `schema.sql` file defines the structure of the database and includes sample data.
2. **Setup**: Use a MySQL or compatible database system to run the SQL commands in `schema.sql` to create and populate the `Seats` table.

## Deployment on StackBlitz

1. **Visit StackBlitz**: Go to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ticket-booking-ars?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts).

2. **Import Project**:
   - Click on the "Import Project" option.
   - Choose the option to upload your project files or link to a Git repository.

3. **Configure**:
   - Ensure all necessary files (`app.component.ts`, `app.component.html`, `app.component.css`, and `schema.sql`) are correctly uploaded.

4. **Run and Test**:
   - Once imported, StackBlitz will automatically install dependencies and start the application.
   - Test the application by interacting with the seat booking interface.

5. **Share**:
   - After deployment, share the URL generated by StackBlitz for the live version of your application.

## Notes

- **Assumptions**: The project assumes that the database setup is handled separately and focuses on the front-end booking system.
- **Pre-Booked Seats**: Initial pre-booked seats are handled in the TypeScript code.
